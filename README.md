# Flash utility for the Radtel RT-890 radio

I wrote this utility because there was no available flasher, official or otherwise, for this radio.
It was written fairly quickly in C# in .NET and thus targets mainly Windows.
It is known to work correctly under Linux with WINE, although the visual appearance may have some glitches.

# Building

Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition was used to build this utility.

# Instructions

Run the executable file to get (simple) instructions.
